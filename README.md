# CI/CD project template

This repository contains a template useful for integrate CI/CD in a project. 

## Setup

After entering the lab environment you will need to run the `setup.sh` script in the `./bin` folder to install the prerequisite software.

```bash
bash bin/setup.sh
```

Then you must exit the shell and start a new one for the Python virtual environment to be activated.

```bash
exit
```
